            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello! My name is Rob Ruddock. I'm a second year Game Develpment and Design student here at RIT. Personally a big fan of playing and making games, hoping I can get in the industry and maybe make some of my own! I hope my time in this major will allow me to develop the skills to do so. Particularly, I'm hoping this class gives me the skills to make appealing websites to host games or even advertise myself to recruiters in the video game industry. Hopefully I can manage to reach my goals!</p>
